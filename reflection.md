In this assignment I felt really overwhelmed with all of the different ways to start, I ended up spending a lot of time making a first prompt that got me halfway there, the other half of the assignment definitely took a whole lot longer! It was often confusing where start trying to edit code that I wasn't already super familiar with, but taking the time to examine it more on my own I came to understand the basic interworkings of the site I was putting together. One thing that frusturated me for a long time was trying to get the quiz section to look 100% like the reference, but subtle alignment changes in the HTML and CSS felt daunting and even after trying lots of things on my own and asking for help from chatgpt I couldn't quite get that last part the way I wanted to. Overall I was pretty satified with my efforts but wanted a little more from my work, even if in the end it was real close. 

I think in a class like this it is obviously important to learn as you work, especially if you're getting assistance from LLMs, it's very much a double edged sword and I want to explore as much as I can in this class, its just a matter of knowing when you're too far deep and need to take a step back so you can build up those core conepts and intuitions.
